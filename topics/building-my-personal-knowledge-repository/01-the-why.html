<p>The basic idea behind having your own personal repository of knowledge is to provide you with a space where you can dump information for your future self.</p>

<figure class="image py-3">
  <img class="rounded-md shadow-sm border border-gray-100" src="/topics/building-my-personal-knowledge-repository/img/notion-person-wiki-categories.png" alt="My Notion categories." />
  <figcaption class="text-sm pt-3 text-gray-500 text-center">
    My Notion categories.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple example would be re-arranging menu bar items on MacOS: Hold down <kbd>⌘</kbd> while dragging items on the menu bar. This simple action can easily be forgotten, when you need it you’ll be trying out the different buttons on your keyboard to figure out the right one (rediscovering the wheel). With a knowledge repository you might have written down the steps and would have been able to quickly retrieve them, together with notes or relevant links.</p>

<p>This example is simple and perhaps <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">not worth the trade off</a> between time spent documenting versus trying out some keys each time. This is up to the owner of the repostiory to determine. However from my past experience with my repostiory in Notion I can say that writing down these things quickly becomes worth it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Next to being able to save time, a knowledge repository allows you to quickly add notes or thoughts to a certain topic such that later once you need to perform a task related to that topic you have access to your thoughts about it from yesterday, three months or even a year ago.</p>

<p>This is especially useful when you, like me, spend time on different sites like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hackernews</a>, <a href="https://github.com/explore">Github</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> and encounter useful articles, repositories or discussions about a topic that could become relevant later (this again is up to yourself to determine). Including these little resources in to your knowledge repository is like giving yourself a head start when you actually dive in to a topic. I’ve found that this has helped me overcome the initial barrier of entry to learning or trying something new.</p>

<hr />

<p>So in short I am building this public repository to help my future self. To help him remember and build upon resources I am collecting now and to give him a head start when trying to learn something new.</p>
