For a while now I've looked up to personal knowledge repositories like the one from [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz). Using [Notion](https://www.notion.so) I've created my own personal repository of knowledge spanning many aspects of my life: from my work with different software libraries or programming languages to strategies for games and general thoughts about life.

Over the last two months I've been trying to find a way to start documenting some of this content online as I think that many of my findings can be useful for others.

{% include subpage.html page='topics/building-my-personal-knowledge-repository/01-the-why.md' color='text-blue-400' %}

It has taken me some time to find the correct format for this but I believe I have now found a way to make this work. Taking some inspiration from others, like the iOS reviews on [macstories](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/) and the application [Craft.do](https://craft.do), I would like to structure the content in my knowledge repository by dividing the content up in to subpages. You've already seen one of these subsections above: titled "The Why". 

Craft created some examples from public letters that showcases how something like this would work, for eaxmple the [2019 anual letter from Bill & Melinda Gates foundation](https://www.craft.do/s/wB8sLc1GjUCs):

{% include figure.html url="/topics/building-my-personal-knowledge-repository/img/craft-do-example.png" description="Craft.Do example subpages example." %}

This type of subdivision makes intuitive sense in my head as it breaks down topics in to smaller blocks, allowing me to build up my knowledge one block at a time. I hope that for the reader it will provide a similar experience.

If you are interested in the source code for this knowledge repository you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/nbelzer/notes). Both the code and content is available there. If you have a suggestion, correction or are having issues with this site you can create an issue there to let me know.
