The ability to use version control properly is a skill every software developer needs. Personally I have only used [Git](https://git-scm.com). 

# Getting Started

There are some great resources available on the web to get started with Git:
- [Scott Hanselman -- Git 101 Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBg9mlpzEYU&list=WL&index=3&t=0s) (YouTube) -- Great introduction IMO.
- [How to write a git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative) -- How to write proper commit messages.
- [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) -- For both beginners and advanced users.

## Interfacing with git
By default you can interface with Git through the command line, which is how I started out using Git. I learned that there are several visual interfaces available but they never allowed me to do what I wanted as quickly as I could using the cli (with some exceptions). This might have been a result of learning to use the cli first though. 

If you are interested in a visual interface for git take a look at your preferred editor as it might already have some sort of interface for Version Control. If it doesn't take a look [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/) for a list of GUI's.

Since the beginning of this year (2020) I've started using [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) which allows you to install an awesome package named [Magit](https://magit.vc). This package allowed me to use git:
- faster (through keybindings), 
- without the need to remember commands or their parameters, and 
- more intuitively by visualising the changes.

If you are using Emacs I highly recommend you to check this package out.
